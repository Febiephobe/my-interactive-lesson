    <p>Welcome to the interactive lesson on Fiber Analysis in Forensic Science. Complete each section, answer the quizzes correctly, and you'll earn a certificate of completion at the end.</p>

    <!-- Topic 1: Introduction -->
    <div id="topic1" class="topic">
        <h2>Topic 1: Introduction to Fiber Analysis</h2>
        <p>
            Fiber analysis is a critical aspect of forensic science, playing a key role in linking individuals to crime scenes and establishing connections between suspects, victims, and criminal activities. This lesson provides an overview of the types of fibers, the role they play in forensic investigations, and the factors that contribute to their transfer and detection. Understanding the properties of different fiber classes helps forensic scientists assess evidence and determine the relevance of fibers in solving crimes.
        </p>
        <p><strong>What is Fiber?</strong><br>
            A fiber is the smallest unit of a textile material, which makes up yarns that are then spun, twisted, or woven together to form fabrics. The characteristics of the fibers, the method of spinning, and the construction of the fabric affect how fibers are transferred during contact and their relevance in criminal investigations.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Role in Criminal Investigations:</strong><br>
            In forensic science, fibers can serve as physical evidence that links a suspect to a crime scene. For instance, fibers found at a crime scene or on a victim can be matched to fibers from a suspect's clothing. This evidence can establish a direct or indirect connection between the suspect and the crime.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Transfer of Fibers:</strong><br>
            Fibers can transfer from one individual to another or from one object to another during contact. These fibers, once transferred, can become crucial evidence that links a suspect to a crime scene or a victim.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Value of Fiber Evidence:</strong><br>
            The value of fiber evidence depends on factors like the fiber’s color, type, the number of fibers found, and their location on the victim or at the crime scene. The more specific and unique the fiber, the stronger the connection between the crime scene and the suspect.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Factors Affecting Fiber Transfer and Detection:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Fabric Type:</strong> Different types of fabric have varying abilities to transfer and retain fibers. For example, loosely woven fabrics tend to shed fibers more easily than tightly woven fabrics.</li>
            <li><strong>Nature of Contact:</strong> The type and duration of contact between a suspect and a victim or a suspect and an object also affect fiber transfer. Prolonged or violent contact is more likely to result in significant fiber transfer.</li>
            <li><strong>Persistence of Fibers:</strong> After fibers are transferred, their ability to remain detectable depends on various factors, including the type of fabric involved, the environment, and the activities that occurred after the transfer.</li>
        </ul>

    <!-- Topic 2: Animal Fibers -->
    <div id="topic2" class="topic">
        <h2>Topic 2: Animal Fibers</h2>
        <p>
            Animal fibers are protein-based and are typically derived from the hair or fur of animals. Common animal fibers include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Angora:</strong> Derived from Angora goats and rabbits, these fibers are soft, fine, and lightweight. They are often used in winter clothing because they are seven times warmer than regular wool.</li>
            <li><strong>Camel Family (Alpaca, Llama, Camel, Vicuña):</strong> These fibers are lightweight, lustrous, and warm. Vicuña fibers are known for being the finest animal fibers in the world, making them rare and valuable.</li>
            <li><strong>Cashmere:</strong> Cashmere fibers, sourced from Kashmir goats, are soft and lightweight. They are commonly used in luxurious garments.</li>
            <li><strong>Wool:</strong> Wool is one of the most common animal fibers, derived from sheep. Wool has unique insulating properties, making it ideal for clothing in cold climates. In forensic investigations, wool can be identified by its surface structure, which contains scales, making it easy to differentiate under microscopic analysis.</li>
            <li><strong>Mohair:</strong> Derived from Angora goats, mohair fibers are durable, resilient, and lightweight. They are used in a variety of fashion and home décor items.</li>
            <li><strong>Silk:</strong> Produced by silkworms, silk fibers are renowned for their strength, shine, and smooth texture. In forensic science, silk fibers are unique due to their distinct molecular structure and high tensile strength, aiding in differentiation from other fiber types.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Special Type:</strong></p>
        <p>
            <strong>Marine Animal Fibers:</strong> Derived from fish or marine mammals, these fibers possess distinct properties compared to terrestrial animal fibers. They may exhibit unique surface textures and resilience due to their aquatic origins, presenting specialized forensic considerations.
